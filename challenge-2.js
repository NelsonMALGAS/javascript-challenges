/**
 * Instructions:
 * Display the posts from the array dynamically within the <ul id="postsList"></ul> element.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Loop through the posts array.
 * 2. For each post, create an <li> element with the class "post-item".
 * 3. Inside the <li>, add:
 *    - An <h3> element for the post title with the class "post-title".
 *    - A <p> element for the post content with the class "post-content".
 * 4. Append the <li> to the <ul> element with the ID "postsList".
 *
 * Hint:
 * Use JavaScript's DOM manipulation methods like `createElement`, `classList.add`, and `appendChild`.
